4. **Future-proof** - Ready for browser AI integration
5. **Open source** - MIT license, community-driven

## 💡 The Vision

This creates a **standard pattern** for AI-enhanced web content. As browser AI becomes ubiquitous in 2025-2026, sites using this pattern will be ready to integrate seamlessly.

The structured prompt format becomes a de facto standard that:
- AI companies can recognize and optimize for
- Browser vendors can detect and enhance
